            <h5>Hage Geingob, born on August 3, 1941, in Grootfontein, Namibia, was a significant figure in the country's political landscape and served as its President until his passing on February 4, 2024.

Elected President of Namibia in 2015 with a remarkable 87% of the vote, he was re-elected in 2019. His presidency was marked by efforts to navigate economic challenges, including the global commodity crisis and severe droughts, while promoting democracy and good governance.
                
                Geingob was known for his approachable personality, often engaging with citizens in informal settings. His commitment to democracy was evident in his involvement in drafting Namibia's constitution, which emphasized human rights. Geingob's legacy includes his dedication to public service and his significant contributions to Namibia's political and social landscape.
